How to create a writeup
When creating a writeup for a challenge please consider the following things:

Be as detailed as possible. Explain the theory behind what you did to solve the challenge instead of simple one line answers like "execute python script.py" and you will get the answer. This is because other students will be reading these writeups as a learning tool so the more theory and thought process you explain the better.
When possible and appropriate add screenshots.
When appropriate provide any scripts that you wrote and used for that challenge.
When possible provide the challenge files that you recieved. Most CTFs are only up for a weekend so the files will not be accessible afterwards.
The suggested file format to do the writeups in is markdown or .md
